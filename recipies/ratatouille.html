        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ratatouille is a French Provencal dish that consists of stewed vegetables. Though recipes and ingredients vary, there are some ingredients that are almost always used: eggplant, tomatoes, zucchini, onions, and bell peppers.</p>


        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil,divided</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 eggplant, cut into 1/2 inch cubes</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried parsley</li>
            <li>salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesean cheese</li>
            <li>2 zucchini, sliced</li>
            <li>2 large tomatoes, chopped</li>
            <li>2 cups sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 large onion, sliced into rings</li>
            <li>1 green or red bell pepper, sliced</li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Coat the bottom and sides of a 1 Â½-quart casserole dish with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Heat remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic until fragrant and golden brown. Add eggplant and parsley; cook and stir until eggplant is tender and soft, about 10 minutes. Season with salt to taste.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Spread eggplant mixture evenly across the bottom of the prepared casserole dish; sprinkle with a few tablespoons of Parmesan cheese. Spread zucchini in an even layer over top. Lightly salt and sprinkle with a little more cheese. Continue layering in this fashion, with tomatoes, mushrooms, onion, and bell pepper, covering each layer with a sprinkling of salt and cheese.</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until vegetables are tender, about 45 minutes.</li>
